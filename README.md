# Docker container for Arduino development

This container provides an installation of the Arduino.cc application and a virtual X11 server.

With version 1.5.8, the command line options to verify a build are not available.

This is not suitable for a CI environment, but the compilers are all available in /usr/local/share/arduino/.
